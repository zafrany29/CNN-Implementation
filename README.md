# CNN-Implementation

This project was developed as part of the Deep Learning course.

## **Main Function:**
Analyzing an image using the CIFAR10 dataset and classifying the object in the image accordingly.

By using a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and experimenting with its depth and hyperparameters, I was able to achieve very good results.
